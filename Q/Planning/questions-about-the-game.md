# Questions About the Game Memorandum

### TO: 'Dot Game' Company

### FROM: Nathan Kirschner and Jackson Terrill

### DATE: September 13, 2023

### SUBJECT: Questions About the Game

We have come up with a few lingering questions about the rules:

- When returning tiles to the referree, in what order are the tiles placed at the end of the referree's collection?

- When placing a tile that extends two contiguous sequences, does that tile get counted twice when scoring?

- When a player gets eliminated by the referree, do their points still count and what happens to their tiles?
